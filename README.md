## Hello, guys! Gustavo here. You can find my studies about <b>Rust</b> language in this repository.

## I'm using [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book to learn this language.

<br>

If you want to see some of my studies, you can clone this repository and run in your machine or copy some code from folder `algorithms` and paste in [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

## Algorithms

- [Secret Number] - A simple game where you have to guess a number between 1 and 100.
